## Motivation
In this project, I aim to explore whether there is a correlation between my daily calorie output and the days I post stories on Instagram. This analysis will provide insights into how social media activity might influence physical activity.

## Description of the Dataset
The dataset for this project will consist of daily records containing the following fields:
- **Date:** The specific day when data is recorded.
- **Calorie Output:** Daily calorie output data collected from my fitness tracker (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health), representing both the base metabolic rate and additional calories burned through physical activity.
- **Instagram Story Activity:** A flag or indicator showing whether I posted a story on Instagram on that day.
- **Weather Data:** Information on weather conditions for that day (e.g., temperature, humidity, weather description) obtained via an API. (Optional)
- **Mood Data:** Self-reported mood ratings, recorded manually to gauge emotional state which might influence physical activity. (Optional)

## Data Sources
- **Calorie Data:** I will be collecting daily calorie output data from my fitness tracker (Apple Health).
- **Instagram Story Data:** I will manually log the days I post stories on Instagram or use Instagramâ€™s data export feature to track story posting dates.

## Data Enrichment
To enrich this dataset, I plan to include:
- **Weather Data:** I will use an API (such as OpenWeather) to gather the weather conditions on the days I post stories, to see if environmental factors influence activity levels.
- **Mood Data:** I will manually log my mood to see if emotional state plays a role in both social media activity and physical activity.

## Analysis Plan
1. **Data Collection:** Over the next month, I will log my calorie output and Instagram story activity daily.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I will explore the patterns between calorie output and Instagram activity, visualizing trends and testing hypotheses.
3. **Statistical Testing:** I will apply statistical tests to determine if there's a significant difference in calorie output on days with and without Instagram story posts.

## Tools
- **Python:** Data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib:** Creating graphs and visualizations.

## Timeline
- **Data Collection:** From March 10th to April 10th.
- **EDA and Hypothesis Testing:** By April 18th.
- **Machine Learning and Final Analysis:** By May 23rd.
- **Final Submission:** By May 30th.

- ## Expected Findings, Limitations, and Future Work
- **Expected Findings:** I anticipate that the analysis will reveal whether there is a significant correlation between Instagram story posting and daily calorie output.
- **Limitations:** As this is a personal dataset, the results may not generalize to a broader population.
- **Future Work:** Future research could expand this analysis to include data from other individuals or integrate more detailed activity tracking for a comprehensive view.
